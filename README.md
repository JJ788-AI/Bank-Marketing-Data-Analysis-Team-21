### Business Case: 
Analyzing Factors Influencing Term Deposit Acquisition

### Research Question: 
How do customer demographics, financial standing, and marketing campaign strategies interact to influence the likelihood of acquiring a term deposit among customers of a banking institution?
This question aims to explore the relationships between these variables and identify the key factors that drive customer decisions regarding term deposits.

### Executive Summary:
This business case explores the relationship between customer demographics, financial standing, and campaign strategy on the likelihood of acquiring a term deposit. By understanding these factors, our bank can refine marketing strategies, improve customer targeting, and ultimately increase term deposit sales.

### Objectives:
1. Identify key customer demographics that influence term deposit acquisition.
2. Assess the impact of financial standing on customer decisions. 
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of current campaign strategies. 
4. Develop actionable recommendations to enhance marketing efforts.

### Background:
Term deposits are a cornerstone of our savings products, providing a secure investment option for customers. However, recent trends indicate a need to better understand the factors influencing customer decisions in order to optimize our marketing strategies and increase conversions.


### Project Process for Customer Term Deposit Analysis

#### **1. Project Initiation**  
- **Task 1.1:** Conduct a kick-off meeting to introduce team members and outline project goals.  
- **Task 1.2:** Define specific objectives and establish success metrics for the analysis.  
- **Task 1.3:** Assign roles and responsibilities to team members.  

#### **2. Data Collection**  
- **Task 2.1:** Identify relevant data sources, including internal databases, public datasets, and CRM systems.  
- **Task 2.2:** Determine necessary variables related to demographics, financial standing, and campaign strategies.  
- **Task 2.3:** Collect datasets, ensuring they include:  
  - **Customer Demographics:** Age, income, location.  
  - **Financial Standing:** Credit scores, existing accounts, debt levels.  
  - **Campaign Data:** Channels, messaging.  

#### **3. Data Preparation**  
- **Task 3.1:** Clean the dataset by removing duplicates, correcting inaccuracies, and handling missing values.  
- **Task 3.2:** Transform the data into a suitable format for analysis (e.g., encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical data).  
- **Task 3.3:** Document the data preparation process for transparency and reproducibility.  

#### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Task 4.1:** Conduct descriptive statistics to summarize data distributions and key characteristics.  
- **Task 4.2:** Create visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify patterns and correlations among variables.  
- **Task 4.3:** Document findings from EDA, highlighting trends or anomalies.   

#### **5. Data Analysis**  
- **Task 5.1:** Select appropriate analytical methods (e.g., regression analysis, logistic regression, correlation analysis).  
- **Task 5.2:** Perform the analysis to test hypotheses, focusing on the interaction between demographics, financial standing, and campaign strategies.  
- **Task 5.3:** Interpret the results in the context of the business case.  

#### **6. Results Interpretation**  
- **Task 6.1:** Analyze and summarize key findings related to customer decisions on term deposits.  
- **Task 6.2:** Identify significant factors influencing the likelihood of acquiring term deposits.
